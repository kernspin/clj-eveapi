Clojure EVE API
===============

This is a simple Clojure library for accessing the EVE Online API.

It aims to provide a simple interface and contains no encoded
knowledge of the EVE API. This future-proofs the implementation
against further EVE API changes and additions.

This library also includes support for local caching of API results.
